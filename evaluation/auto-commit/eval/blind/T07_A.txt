fix: ensure profiler events are captured during errors

  Previously, if an error was thrown during change detection, component rendering, or host binding updates, the corresponding profiler "end" events would not be emitted.
  This could lead to inaccurate profiling data and dangling start events.

  This change wraps the potentially error-prone operations in try...finally blocks to guarantee that the profiler end events are always captured, even when an error
  occurs.
