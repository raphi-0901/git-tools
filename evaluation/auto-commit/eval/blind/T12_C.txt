feat: add name_loc to AST nodes and refactor directive interfaces

This commit introduces  properties to various AST nodes in the parser output,
providing more precise source location information for element and attribute names.
Additionally, directive interfaces have been refactored to extend a new
interface, improving consistency and maintainability of the AST definition.

The parser snapshots have been updated to reflect these changes.
