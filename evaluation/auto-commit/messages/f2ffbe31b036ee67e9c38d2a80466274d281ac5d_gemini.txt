feat(devtools): improve router guard name extraction and display

Enhances the Angular DevTools router tree to correctly extract and display names for various guard types, including named functions, arrow functions, and class instances.

Also, adds a user-friendly message when attempting to view the source of inline (arrow or anonymous) guard functions, as their source cannot be directly navigated.
