refactor(api-inject): use getCurrentInstance() consistently

This commit refactors the `inject` and `hasInjectionContext` functions
in `runtime-core` to consistently use `getCurrentInstance()`.
This change removes direct reliance on `currentInstance` and
`currentRenderingInstance` for context retrieval,
improving consistency and maintainability.
