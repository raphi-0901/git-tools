feat: support shadowRoot false in defineCustomElement

This change introduces the ability to define custom elements with shadowRoot false.
Previously, custom elements always rendered with a shadow DOM. This new option allows
rendering custom elements directly into the light DOM, which is useful for certain
styling and integration scenarios.

The renderSlot helper has been updated to correctly handle slot content when
shadowRoot false is enabled, ensuring that injected content replaces the
slot element as expected. Comprehensive tests have been added to verify
the behavior of custom elements and their slots in this mode.
