feat: export MountOptions type and use it in mount function

Export the MountOptions type from svelte/src/index.d.ts and svelte/types/index.d.ts
to allow external usage and improve type clarity for the mount function.
The mount function in svelte/src/internal/client/render.js now uses this
exported type.
