refactor: Rename reactivity concepts and update effect destruction

Rename 'consumer' to 'reaction' and related properties (e.g., 'signal.d' to 'signal.deps', 'signal.c' to 'signal.reactions') for clarity and consistency within the reactivity system.
Update effect destruction logic by renaming 'destroy_signal' to 'destroy_effect' and modifying its implementation.
Adjust 'is_runes' function signature and 'update_derived' logic to align with these changes.
