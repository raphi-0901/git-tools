feat: Ensure profiler events are captured during errors

Wrap change detection and rendering logic in try...finally blocks
to guarantee that profiler end events are always emitted,
even when errors occur during the process.

This change improves the reliability of profiling data by ensuring
that the start and end events for various operations (like change
detection, component rendering, and host binding updates) are
symmetrically captured, providing a more accurate representation
of execution flow, especially in scenarios involving exceptions.

Additionally, new test cases have been added to verify that profiler
events are correctly captured when errors are thrown during component
creation, change detection, and host binding evaluation.
