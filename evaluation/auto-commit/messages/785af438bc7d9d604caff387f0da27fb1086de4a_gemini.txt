feat(devtools): add E2E tests for injector tree tab

Adds Cypress E2E tests for the injector tree tab in Angular DevTools.
This includes tests for:
- Displaying the injector tree
- Hiding framework injectors
- Hiding injectors with no providers
- Displaying providers for selected nodes
- Filtering providers

Also adds a 'provider-row' class to the injector-providers component HTML
to facilitate testing.
